# ImpleMed Dental Website Project

Welcome to the ImpleMed Dental website project! This project aims to create a website for ImpleMed Dental, a business owned by Sandy Buechler, to help promote her dental services and provide information to potential clients.

## Project Overview

This project is my first attempt at building a website from scratch. I am learning HTML and CSS as I go, and this project serves as both a learning experience and a practical application of my skills.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Provides an introduction to ImpleMed Dental, including information about services offered, contact details, and maybe a brief about the team.
- **Services Page**: Details the dental services provided by ImpleMed Dental, possibly with descriptions and images.
- **Contact Page**: Allows visitors to get in touch with ImpleMed Dental via a contact form or provided contact information.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website looks good and functions well across various devices and screen sizes.
